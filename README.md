# BRECI
Binned Relative Environmental Change Indicator (BRECI) for displaying differences between ENM output maps

This little R-package produces plots which give an intuitive representation of the nature of differences between rasters produced by Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). ENMs are also frequently referred to as Species Distribution Models (SDMs), Ecological Niche Models, or habitat suitability models.

The purpose of the package is to help you communicate how two rasters differ. It does not provide statistical measures of difference. It is purely an aid to communication and to give some indication of the nture of differences.

## Installing from this GitHub repository

Ensure that the R-package devtools is available in your local R installation. In the R console type the following:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("peterbat1/BRECI")
```
